#Model-Evaluation 

#CO2 Emission Prediction: 

*Generated Regression plot and Scatter Plot using seaborn and Matplotlib libraries and concluded the model is Linear.

*Predicted the Carbon DiOxide emission for several cars with the help of ENGINESIZE,FUELCONSUMPTION COMBINED,CYLINDERS,FUELCONSUMPTION_HWY,FUELCONSUMPTION_CITY      using Scikit learn(linear models) in g/km with an accuracy of 87%.

Tools used: 

Pandas,Scikit-Learn,Seaborn,Matplotlib
